# 🧱 Vue.js Web Page Builder

A simple **Web Page Builder** built using **Vue.js**.  
This project was created as a **practice project** to explore and understand various concepts of **Frontend Development** — including component-based architecture, responsive design, and client-side authentication.

This project provides an **interactive page builder** that allows users to create and preview web pages in real time.  
You can add various elements such as:

- 🖼️ **Images**
